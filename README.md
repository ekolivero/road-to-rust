## Road to Rust
This repo contains all the resources I've used in my journey to learn rust. I'll keep track of all the progress using [github projects](https://github.com/users/erik18xk/projects/3)

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
